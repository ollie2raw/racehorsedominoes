## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd racehorse-dominoes

# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

## Running the App

You need two terminals:

### Terminal 1: Server (port 3001)
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

### Terminal 2: Client (port 5173)
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in two browser windows to play.

## Running Tests

```bash
cd server
npm test
```

## Building for Production

### Server
```bash
cd server
npm run build
npm start
```

### Client
```bash
cd client
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Game Rules Summary

### Setup
- Double-six tile set (28 tiles)
- Each player draws 7 tiles
- 2 tiles are "dead" and cannot be drawn

### Opening
- First play must be a double OR a tile that scores

### Play
- Match a tile to any open end (main line left/right, or branch ends)
- Playing a double grants an extra turn
- Scoring (open ends sum divisible by 5) grants an extra turn
- Extra turns can chain

### Branching
- When a double is "crossed" (another tile played through it on the main line), it becomes a hub
- Each hub can spawn up to 2 branch arms
- Branch ends count toward the open ends sum for scoring

### Cannot Go Out
- You cannot play your last tile if it's a double
- You cannot play your last tile if it would score

### Blocked Hand
- When all players pass consecutively, the hand is blocked
- Player with lowest pip count wins
- Winner receives opponent's pip penalty (rounded up to nearest 5)
